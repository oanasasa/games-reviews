**Games reviews**

It's a static website that collects opinions and reviews for a predefined list of games. 
These games are my favorite ones but you can change it with any other that you want.

**Created in:** Next JS (.jsx)
**Using:** Tailwind and custom CSS
**Integration:** API that renders the games and the reviews
**Media and Fonts:** They are all inside the project and the images are stock.
